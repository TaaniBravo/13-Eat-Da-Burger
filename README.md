# 13-Eat-Da-Burger

This is the homework assignment for Unit 13 of the UW Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, I've created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). 

I used Sass CSS as well although I definitely did not use it to its full potential as I just wanted to get comfortable with so I can use it more dynamically in future projects.
